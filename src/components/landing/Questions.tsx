        <p>
          We&rsquo;ve already made some amazing posters for you, so all you have
          to do is print them out from our platform and put them up for people
          to see! Please remember to follow any local laws about putting up
          posters - you could look into places like local shops or community
          boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&rsquo;re planning to add referral links too, but for now it&rsquo;s
          posters only.

    question: "Who can apply?",
    answers: (

        <p>
          Teenagers aged 13-18 from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada,
          Europe, Australia, and New Zealand can apply. You&rsquo;ll need to be
          able to get to places around your city - this may involve walking,
          biking, driving, or taking public transit, it&rsquo;s up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope to add more countries in the future, but this is a brand new
          program, so we&rsquo;re trying it out first in a small number of
          areas.

    answers: (

        <p>
          We highly reccomend you run meetups, but it is not a hard requirement. If you do not run the meetups you will not be eligible for the $100 honorarium.

    question: "What does a meetup look like?",

        <p>
          A meetup isn't anything big like a Campfire or a Daydream. It's just you and some Hack Clubbers from your city hanging out and making projects! This is not a formal event.
